# bolides-questions

Subject of my IB computer science Internal Assessment, it's a clone of bolides that asks questions when you get hit. The questions are stored in a text file on the server computer, which can be added or removed using the main UI, and are dynamically loaded when they are needed.
Pretty ugly like its predecessor, and it's very much a conglomerate of assorted pieces that meets technical requirements.
